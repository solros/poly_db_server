This file documents the steps I performed on the polymake server in order to get the database running.

* Install MongoDB
	- Download and move everything into /usr/local/bin

* Install pymongo (Python module):
	sudo easy_install pymongo

* Set up a config file /etc/mongodb.conf:

	fork = true		(needed to run mongodb as deamon)
	port = 27017
	quiet = true
	dbpath = /polymake/mongodb	(here all data will be stored)
	logpath = /polymake/mongodb/log/mongod.log	(logfile)
	logappend = true	(do not overwrite existing logfile)
	journal = true
	auth = true

* A second config file for easier administration and data insertion:

	fork = true		(needed to run mongodb as deamon)
	bind_ip = 127.0.0.1
	port = 27017
	quiet = true
	dbpath = /polymake/mongodb	(here all data will be stored)
	logpath = /polymake/mongodb/log/mongod.log	(logfile)
	logappend = true	(do not overwrite existing logfile)
	journal = true



* Make sure the folder /polymake/mongodb and everything below belongs to polytrac

* Start Mongo Deamon (as polytrac):
	mongod --config /etc/mongodb.conf

* Insert data using xml2db.py. (This takes as input a database_name, a collection_name, a contributor and a list of polymake files -- currently it prints processing time.) -- The data then goes into database_name.collection_name.

* open up port 27017 
	- on polymake server at TUD we have to edit Holger's firewall settings

* authentication
	- useradmin with roles: userAdminAnyDatabase (manages users, MongoDB superuser)
	- admin with roles: dbAdminAnyDatabase, readWriteAnyDatabase, clusterAdmin
	- silke with roles: readWriteAnyDatabase
	- polymake with roles: read (user for everyone, may only read certain databases, password is 'database')


* If you start a new database make sure polymake user has read access.
	use new_db
	db.addUser({user:"polymake", userSource:"admin", roles: ["read"]})


* To stop the mongo daemon do:
	use admin
	db.shutdownServer()


TODOs:

* discuss database structure
* preprocess polymake files (compute missing props)
* indexing

* web interface
